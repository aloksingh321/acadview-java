1.git config
Sets configuration values for your user name, email, gpg key, preferred diff algorithm, file formats and more. Examples:


2.git config --global user.name "My Name"
git config --global user.email "user@domain.com"
git init
Initializes a git repository – creates the initial .git directory in a new or in an existing project. Example:

3.git init
 
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/username/GIT/.git/
git clone
Creates a GIT repository copy from a remote source. Also adds the original location as a remote so you can fetch from it again and push to it if you have permissions. Example:


4.git clone git@github.com:user/test.git
git add
Adds files changes in your working directory to your index. Example:


5.git add .
git rm
Removes files from your index and your working directory so they will not be tracked. Example:


6.git rm filename
git commit
Takes all of the changes written in the index, creates a new commit object pointing to it and sets the branch to point to that new commit. Examples:

7.git commit -m ‘committing added changes’
git commit -a -m ‘committing all changes, equals to git add and git commit’
git status
Shows you the status of files in the index versus the working directory. It will list out files that are untracked (only in your working directory), modified (tracked but not yet updated in your index), and staged (added to your index and ready for committing). Example:


8.git status
 
# On branch master #
# Initial commit #
# Untracked files: #
# (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed) #
 
README
git branch
Lists existing branches, including remote branches if ‘-a’ is provided. Creates a new branch if a branch name is provided. Example:


9.git branch -a * master remotes/origin/master
git merge
Merges one or more branches into your current branch and automatically creates a new commit if there are no conflicts. Example:


10.git merge newbranchversion
git reset
Resets your index and working directory to the state of your last commit. Example:


11.git reset --hard HEAD
git tag
Tags a specific commit with a simple, human readable handle that never moves. Example:

git pull
Fetches the files from the remote repository and merges it with your local one. Example:


12.git pull origin
git push
Pushes all the modified local objects to the remote repository and advances its branches. Example:


13. git push origin master
git remote

14. git remote origin
git log
Shows a listing of commits on a branch including the corresponding details. Example:


15.git log commit
 
16.git diff
git archive
Creates a tar or zip file including the contents of a single tree from your repository. Example:


17. git archive --format=zip master^ README >file.zip
git gc
Garbage collector for your repository. Optimizes your repository. Should be run occasionally. Example


18. git fsck
git prune
Removes objects that are no longer pointed to by any object in any reachable branch. Example:


19. git prune
